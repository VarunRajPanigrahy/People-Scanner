People Scanner


Our project involves a real-time attendance system based on facial recognition for high accuracy while leaving no chance of a wrong attendance.

traditional attendance methods are prone to errors due to proxies and even advanced methods like biometrics are not perfect as people have found out ways to forge fingerprints on sensors using wax or rubber. Our project overcomes all these shortcomings. The only way to be marked present here is to be actually present there(Unless you are Arya Stark :p).
